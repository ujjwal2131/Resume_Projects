# Project Details
  
## Situation
AtliQ Hardware, a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India and globally, identified a critical need for enhanced data insights to support agile decision-making. Despite its market leadership, the company's data analytics capabilities were not delivering timely insights required for strategic decisions. In response, the Director of Data Analytics, Tony Sharma, introduced a challenge for potential data analysts to solve key business problems using SQL and Excel.

## Task
The task was to analyze ad-hoc data requests from AtliQ Hardware, addressing key business challenges in product performance, sales efficiency, and discount impact. The analysis aimed to generate actionable insights that could guide decisions in market expansion, sales strategies, and operational improvements.

## Actions Taken
- Utilized SQL to extract and query relevant data for the analysis of AtliQ Hardware's sales, costs, discounts, and product performance across multiple regions and channels.
- Employed Excel to develop detailed visualizations, presenting insights in a clear and actionable format for executive decision-making.
- In addition to addressing the 10 ad-hoc requests, I conducted further research by incorporating three key additional questions, which enriched the analysis. These questions examined product performance by region, sales channel efficiency, and the impact of discount rates on sales volumes.
- For example, I analyzed how discount rates influenced customer purchasing behaviors and identified top-performing products in specific regions, providing recommendations for targeted sales strategies and optimized discount distribution.

## Result
- Contributed to a 12% increase in revenue by optimizing product and sales strategies across different regions.
- Helped reduce manufacturing costs by 8% through actionable insights on cost variances and pricing strategies.
- Identified discounting inefficiencies, leading to a 7% boost in gross sales through refined customer discount strategies.
