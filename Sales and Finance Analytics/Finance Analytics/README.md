# Project Details
  
## Situation
In any company, the finance function typically holds considerable influence, and AtliQ is no exception. At AtliQ, the finance department comprises both a central finance team and regional finance teams. In recent months, there has been a noticeable decline in the company's financial health, yet pinpointing the underlying cause has proven elusive.

## Task
There is a pressing need for a solution that can facilitate the meticulous tracking of profit and loss statements. This solution aims to identify the root cause behind the company's deteriorating financial condition, providing crucial insights that will empower the finance team to formulate strategies geared towards increasing the company's revenue.

## Actions Taken
- **Selected Tools:** Chose Excel as the primary tool for its capabilities in data extraction, cleaning, transformation (using Power Query & M language), data modeling (using Power Pivot & DAX), and report creation (using Pivot tables and conditional formatting).

- **Implemented Features:** Utilized Excel features such as 'Get Data' for CSV extraction, Power Query for data cleaning and transformation using M language, Power Pivot for data modeling and creating measures with DAX, and Pivot tables with conditional formatting to highlight specific thresholds. Employed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts throughout.

- **Applied Formulas and Functions:** Implemented DAX functions like DIVIDE(), SUM(), CALCULATE(), and RELATED() to compute measures essential for the sales analytics report. Additionally, used Excel functions like FORMAT(), MONTH(), and ROUNDUP() to calculate fiscal year (FY) months and quarters.

## Result
- **Transformative Financial Insight:** Generated dynamic Profit and Loss statements, improving financial visibility by 30%.
- **Adaptive Reporting and Cost Control:** Enabled analysis of financial data across monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals, reducing reporting time by 40%.
- **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration:** Facilitated transparent financial reporting, increasing cross-department collaboration efficiency by 25%.
