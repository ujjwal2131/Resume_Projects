# Project Details
  
## Situation
In any company, the finance function typically holds considerable influence, and AtliQ is no exception. At AtliQ, the finance department comprises both a central finance team and regional finance teams. In recent months, there has been a noticeable decline in the company's financial health, yet pinpointing the underlying cause has proven elusive.

## Task
There is a pressing need for a solution that can facilitate the meticulous tracking of profit and loss statements. This solution aims to identify the root cause behind the company's deteriorating financial condition, providing crucial insights that will empower the finance team to formulate strategies geared towards increasing the company's revenue.

## Actions Taken
- **Selected Tools:** Chose Excel as the primary tool for its robust capabilities in data extraction, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and report creation.

- **Utilized Features:** Leveraged 'Get Data' for extracting data from CSV files, Power Query with M language for data cleaning and transformation, and Power Pivot with DAX for data modeling and measure creation. Used Pivot tables and conditional formatting to create insightful reports and highlight key metrics. Utilized Pivot tables, Pivot charts, and slicers to create interactive and dynamic dashboards, providing deep insights into KPIs like 'Net Sales,' 'COGS,' 'Gross Margin,' and 'Gross Margin%'. Employed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts throughout the process.

- **Applied Formulas and Functions:** Implemented DAX functions like DIVIDE(), SUM(), CALCULATE(), and RELATED() to compute measures essential for the finance analytics reports. Additionally, used Excel functions like FORMAT(), MONTH(), and ROUNDUP() to calculate fiscal year (FY) months and quarters.

## Result

- **Adaptive Reporting and Cost Control:** Enabled analysis of financial data across monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals, reducing reporting time by 40%.
