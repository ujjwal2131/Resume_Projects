## Situation
Loki, the Sales Manager at AtliQ Hardware, faces challenges in optimizing sales strategies to maximize profitability and strengthen relationships with the company’s diverse customer base. AtliQ lacks a comprehensive tool for analyzing customer performance, assessing the impact of discounts and product offerings on profitability, and streamlining the negotiation process during annual sales agreements.

## Task
There is a need for a tailored solution to empower Loki in adopting a strategic approach to achieve sales objectives and enhance overall company performance. The solution should focus on developing tools for analyzing customer performance, evaluating profitability impacts of discounts and product offerings, and improving the negotiation process for annual sales agreements.

## Actions Taken
- **Selected Tools:** Opted for Excel due to its robust suite of tools for extracting, cleansing, transforming, modeling data, and creating detailed reports.

- **Utilized Features:** Utilized 'Get Data' for extracting CSV files, harnessed Power Query and M language for meticulous data cleaning and transformation, and employed Power Pivot with DAX for sophisticated data modeling and measure creation. Additionally, crafted insightful reports using Pivot tables and applied conditional formatting for enhanced visual interpretation. Created a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard using Pivot tables, Pivot charts, and slicers to visualize KPIs including 'Net Sales,' 'E-Commerce Net Sales,' 'Brick & Mortar Net Sales,' and 'Sold Quantity.' Extensively leveraged Excel’s capabilities, including the creation of a custom date table for fiscal year analysis, while incorporating ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts throughout the data processing pipeline.

- **Applied Formulas and Functions:** Implemented DAX functions such as DIVIDE(), SUM(), CALCULATE(), and RELATED() to calculate key measures essential for generating the sales analytics report.
