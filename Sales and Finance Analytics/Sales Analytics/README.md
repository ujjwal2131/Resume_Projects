## Situation
Loki, the Sales Manager at AtliQ Hardware, faces challenges in optimizing sales strategies to maximize profitability and strengthen relationships with the companyâ€™s diverse customer base. AtliQ lacks a comprehensive tool for analyzing customer performance, assessing the impact of discounts and product offerings on profitability, and streamlining the negotiation process during annual sales agreements.

## Task
There is a need for a tailored solution to empower Loki in adopting a strategic approach to achieve sales objectives and enhance overall company performance. The solution should focus on developing tools for analyzing customer performance, evaluating profitability impacts of discounts and product offerings, and improving the negotiation process for annual sales agreements.

## Actions Taken
- **Selected Tools:** Chose Excel as the primary tool, leveraging 'Get Data' for CSV extraction, Power Query and M language for data cleaning and transformation, and Power Pivot with DAX for data modeling and creating measures. Also used Pivot tables for report creation and conditional formatting for visual insights.

- **Implemented Features:** Utilized Excel features comprehensively, including creating a custom date table for fiscal year analysis, applying ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts throughout the data processing pipeline.

- **Applied Formulas and Functions:** Implemented DAX functions such as DIVIDE(), SUM(), CALCULATE(), and RELATED() to calculate key measures essential for generating the sales analytics report.
